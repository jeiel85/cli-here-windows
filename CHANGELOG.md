### Added

- Added a modern theme resource dictionary (`Themes/ModernTheme.xaml`) with color tokens and shared control styles.

### Fixed

- Changed release packaging to multi-file framework-dependent mode (`PublishSingleFile=false`) to avoid large single executable startup delays and packaging ambiguity.

- Refreskinned the main settings window from default system-look layout to a card-based UI with clearer hierarchy and improved action affordance.

### Verification

- `dotnet build --configuration Release` passed.
- `dotnet test --configuration Release` passed.
- `./scripts/publish.ps1` passed.
- Release app launch check passed (`CliHere.exe` process alive).

### Changed

- Fixed oversized artifact path by aligning local `scripts/publish.ps1` with framework-dependent release mode.
- Added symbol-stripping publish flags in release/publish pipeline (`DebugType=None`, `DebugSymbols=false`) to keep artifacts lean.
- Refined README language flow and added GitHub Pages branding entrypoint.

### Verification
